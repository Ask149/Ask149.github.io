I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon Development Center Pvt. Ltd. (India). Before working at Amazon, I worked as a Software Developer at Barclays for two years, where I worked on developing a card processor product. I have experience designing scalable systems and microservices-based on AWS, Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS. In addition, I am also an active open source contributor and have recently been a Mentor at CERN-HSF during the Google Summer of Code 2021 program. Topics that interest me are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Convolutional Neural Networks, General Purpose AI.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science from Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) in 2019. I was also a student developer at the CERN-HSF organization during the Google Summer of Code 2019 program. I am proficient in Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript programming languages. I continually seek to improve myself and have proven the same over the past years through my projects, skills, and experiences.
