Certainly, here's an improved version of the "about" section:

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Arizona State University. My passion lies in the intersection of sports programming, machine learning, and building scalable platforms. During the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of working as a Software Engineering Intern at Google LLC, where I gained valuable industry experience and expanded my skill set.

Before my internship at Google, I served as a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon Development Center Pvt. Ltd. in India. Here, I played a crucial role in designing and developing scalable systems and microservices, utilizing technologies such as AWS, Java, Spring Boot, and ReactJS. This experience honed my expertise in building robust and efficient platforms.

My professional journey also includes a role as a Graduate Analyst at Barclays, where I contributed to various projects, including the card processing engine and the fraud case management platform. These experiences provided me with a deep understanding of financial technology and complex systems.

I am an active open-source contributor, and my commitment to the open-source community led me to mentor at CERN-HSF during the Google Summer of Code 2021 program. I'm particularly enthusiastic about topics in Artificial Intelligence, with a keen interest in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Convolutional Neural Networks, and General Purpose AI.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) in 2019. During this time, I also served as a Student Developer at CERN-HSF during the Google Summer of Code 2019 program. My programming skills encompass Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript, and I am continuously seeking ways to enhance my knowledge and skills.

Please don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out via email. I'm always open to networking and exploring new opportunities.
