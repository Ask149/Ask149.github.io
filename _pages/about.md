I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University with AI specialization. I am passionate about sports programming, machine learning, and working on scalable platforms. I worked as a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon Development Center Pvt. Ltd. (India). During my tenure at Barclays as a Graduate Analyst,  I worked on multiple projects such as card processing engine, and working on fraud case management platform. 

I have experience designing scalable systems and microservices based on AWS, Java, Spring Boot, and ReactJS. In addition, I am also an active open-source contributor and recently mentored at CERN-HSF during the Google Summer of Code 2021 program. AI Topics that interest me are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Convolutional Neural Networks, and General Purpose AI.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) in 2019. I was also a Student Developer at the CERN-HSF organization during the Google Summer of Code 2019 program. I am proficient in Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript programming languages. I continually seek to improve myself and have proven the same over the past years through my projects, skills, and experiences. Do reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email.
