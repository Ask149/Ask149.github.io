Welcome to my digital space!

Currently on a journey of mastering the art of **Artificial Intelligence**, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at **Arizona State University**. I thrive at the crossroads of **sports programming**, **machine learning**, and crafting scalable platforms. Presently, I'm diving into uncharted territories as a Software Engineering Intern at **Tesla**, immersed in an exhilarating new tech stack.

My summer of 2023 was painted with the Google colors as I embraced the role of a Software Engineering Intern at **Google LLC**. The experience was a symphony of learning, innovation, and hands-on industry exposure, expanding my skill set under the **Google** umbrella.

Before the Google adventure, I wielded my coding prowess as a Software Development Engineer II at **Amazon Development Center Pvt. Ltd.** in India. In the realm of scalable systems and microservices, I danced with **AWS**, **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **ReactJS**, crafting robust and efficient platforms.

My professional saga includes a stint as a Graduate Analyst at **Barclays**, where I contributed to projects ranging from card processing engines to fraud case management platforms. These endeavors deepened my understanding of **financial technology** and navigating complex systems.

A fervent advocate of the open-source community, I donned the mentor hat at **CERN-HSF** during the **Google Summer of Code 2021** program. My passion resonates with **Artificial Intelligence**, with a special fondness for **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks**, and **General Purpose AI**.

My undergraduate chapter unfolded at the **Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT)** in 2019. As a Student Developer at **CERN-HSF** during the **Google Summer of Code 2019** program, I honed my skills in **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**, ever eager to push the boundaries of my knowledge.
