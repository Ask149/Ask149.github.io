I am a Software Developer at Barclays, where I am working on the design and development in the initial stages of a card processor product. I am an active contributor to open-source software and I am currently a Mentor at CERN-HSF during the Google Summer of Code 2021 program. I was a student developer at the CERN-HSF organization during the Google Summer of Code 2019 program. I continually seek for improving myself and have proven the same over the past years through my projects, skills, and experiences.
