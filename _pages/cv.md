  * Leveraged AWS tools and contributed new product features responsible for billing interest calculation and pre-processing. 
  * Implemented an automated testing application using ReactJS that helped in lessening over 66% manual efforts across a 15+ person QA team.
  * Worked on the development of projects that accounted for a reduction in the workload of customer support agents over 30%, especially during the COVID outbreak with agents working with a limited capacity.
  * Established a monitoring service with a didactic GUI using open source technologies to ameliorate management experience and monitor the service status.
  * Helped a senior analyst to learn machine learning concepts and utilize the latest data analysis tools & technologies via python programming language as a Mentor, during the year-long Reverse Mentoring Program.

* May 2021 - Present: Mentor at Google Summer of Code 2021 with CERN-HSF
  * Architected the foundation of Inference Code Generation for Batch Normalization by designing GPU based software infrastructure.
  * Accountable for assessing 25+ project proposals and mentor students for three months to implement the TMVA Deep Learning model.

* December 2019 - January 2020: Mentor at Google Code-In 2019 with Tensorflow
  * Assisted more than 25 pre-university students to learn fundamentals of machine learning and guided them to implement ML models such as Classifiers, Auto-Encoders, etc
  * Introduced Git and standard coding practices to various students and encouraged open source contribution.

* May 2019 - August 2019: Student Developer at Google Summer of Code 2019 with CERN-HSF
  * Proposed a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) model in the toolkit for multivariate analysis (TMVA) library to simulate high energy physics applications.
  * Designed and integrated de-convolution layers viz. UpSampling layer, Transpose Convolution layer, etc., in the TMVA Deep Neural Network (DNN) library for architectures including CUDA implementation.
  * Overhauled existing implementations and lessened critical vulnerabilities in the user-defined data types.

* July 2018 - April 2019 - Present: Project Intern at BMC Software Inc.
  * Ameliorated the disaster recovery mechanism by implementing a crisis management application for managing the projects and assets
  * Created a dashboard and implemented APIs for real-time monitoring of the projects to maintain business continuity.
  * Authored and published a paper on Smart Business Continuity Application in International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering, and Technology ( IJIRSET ), March 2019, Vol. 8, Issue 3, ISSN: 2319-8753.

* June 2018 - August 2018: Data Science Intern at NonStop IO Technologies
  * Effected a python project to collect the news articles from the feeds daily, analyze the collected news feed through a sentiment analysis model, and generate insights separately for each author
  * Revitalized the customer experience by presenting articles with detailed authors sentiment to help them validate if an author is genuinely indifferent towards the topic.

======
* Volunteered at International Conference on Machine Learning, (ICML) 2020. Contributed to flawless orchestration of the first-ever virtual conference.
* Bagged the second position amongst over 600 students who participated in the competitive programming contest CodersBit - Pan India Annual Coding Challenge that covers over 300 Colleges all over India.
* Supervised students across India to contribute to open source projects by implementing complex algorithms in C++ over a three-month program, GirlScript Summer of Code.
* Ranked 4th at Google India Hackathon 2018 amongst 32 shortlisted teams for the onsite competition by delivering a solution to the problem of Waste Segregation.
* Administered as Organizer and Web Developer at PICT IEEE Students Branch 2017. Led a team of 6 to organize an event ‘WallStreet’ - a stock market simulation event during the technical fest at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. Managed over 20 members to promote the participation by conducting campaigns across the state which resulted in 3000+ student participation in the technical fest - highest registrations ever for the event.
* Ranked 2nd of over 60 participating students in Intra-college Presentation contest 2017 by delivering a presentation on the topic - Gravitational Time Dilation
