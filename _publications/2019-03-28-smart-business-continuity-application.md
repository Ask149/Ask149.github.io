excerpt: 'In the current scenario, the Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) and Disaster Recovery Plans (DRs) in organizations are written using typical word processing tools. The monitoring of projects and triggering of these plans must be done manually. Here, we propose a Smart Business Continuity Application which shall allow an end user to store the BCPs for various projects of an organization in an Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) server. As soon as an asset or a service goes down due to a disaster, its backup, as mentioned in the project’s BCP, takes over its working. The admin of the organization is  automatically notified of such incidents and he can check status of impacted projects at a glance. There is a provision to trigger BCPs for severely impacted projects by a single
click.'
